    Please fill out the SoO correctly by writing NA / deleting unused sections.

    Centre aligned documents aren't great for professional / academic purposes, 
    use left align or justify.

    A function would have been a better idea than a macro. Using a macro for large 
    amounts of code is generally a bad idea.

    "This is equal to total hertz / frequency", total hertz means nothing, you are looking 
    for 'sample rate'.

    You're talking a bit too close to code, there is no real need to mention registers 
    unless you are explaining a tricky function or stack interaction.
