    Well done on generating the song correctly.

    Please fill out the SoO correctly, if you have nothing to put in a section 
    then write N/A or delete that section.
    Your song is very quiet, I could barely hear it at the default setting
    You have your use of functions and macros backwards, your main loop for 
    playing sound should be a function and if you want to use macros to 
    setup the durations / frequencies then that would be much better.
    There is also something wrong with your audio calls, making each note start and 
    end with a strange 'pop' sound.
